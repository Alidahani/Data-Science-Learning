### Summary

Data is growing faster than ever. In this session we'll use data and curiosity to ask questions and make decisions about cars, houses, and health care. You'll see how to use data to solve any problem.

### Abstract

Step 1: Ask questions

Step 2: Look at data

Step 3: Profit

Data is growing faster than ever. Anyone who can use data to make decisions has a big advantage and is in high demand.

Join fellow data geek Dev Nambi and learn how to answer thorny questions about cars, houses, and health care. We'll use clever questions, free data, and common tools like Excel, T-SQL, and Powershell.

You'll also learn general techniques to make sound data-based decisions for any problem.

## Acquire, clean up the Data
It's amazing just how much is necessary.


## Statistics

* First, visualize the data (density, histograms)
* Don't use mean (average) or standard deviation if it's not normal
* Correlation != causation. But sometimes correlation is enough. And !Correlation = !Causation
* Don't use complicated plots. Look at things you can understand.
* Bar and scatter plots are amazing for this
* Don't assume linear. Almost nothing is. Use exponents and logs to make this easy




# Notes to self
