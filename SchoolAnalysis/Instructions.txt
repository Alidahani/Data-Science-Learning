Raw and/or not cleaned up data
\RawData - contains most of the raw data for this analysis. This is not-cleaned, not-merged data, and has some data errors.
\FirstPass - a lot of the information from \RawData, as well as the results of a lot of HTML parsing. 

There was a lot of data cleaning done in SQL. That data is here, in the SchoolAnalysis.bak file, which is a SQL Server 2012 backup file.

Cleaned Up Data:
SchoolDataForR-2013-01-11.csv - the resulting file that is being used for analysis in R.
TableauSchoolData-Agg.xlsx - an Excel file with the data being used for Tableau graphing.
TableauSchoolData-PerYear.xlsx - an Excel file with the final data being used for year-over-year analysis in Tableau.
